### Hi, I'm Rob, a PhD candidate and Vanier Scholar at U Toronto :canada:

- I'm broadly interested in aquatic, molecular, and quantitative ecology, with a particular focus on understanding how aquatic biodiversityâ€”at both local and global scalesâ€”responds to environmental change and human disturbances
- For my PhD, I'm working with [Marty Krkosek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto
- My research projects include:
    - biodiversity responses to heat stress via environmental RNA and DNA 
    - wild salmon conservation in collaboration with the [Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw Fisheries Group](https://mdfgfisheries.ca/) and [Salmon Coast](https://salmoncoast.org/) :fish: 
    - nonlinear population dynamics to understand why populations fluctuate as they do
