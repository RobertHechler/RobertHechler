### Hi, I'm Rob, a PhD candidate and Vanier Scholar at U Toronto :canada:

- I'm interested in understanding how aquatic biodiversity responds to environmental change and do this using molecular and quantitative methods. I enjoy working both at global and local scales with rights and stakeholders in order to produce work that informs policy and conservation practices.
- For my PhD, I'm working with [Marty Krkosek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
- My research projects include:
    - wild salmon conservation in collaboration with the [Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw Fisheries Group](https://mdfgfisheries.ca/) and [Salmon Coast](https://salmoncoast.org/) :fish: 
    - species responses to heat stress 
    - developing new environmental RNA and DNA tools for biomonitoring  
    - nonlinear population dynamics to understand why populations fluctuate as they do
