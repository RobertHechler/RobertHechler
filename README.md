### Hi, I'm Rob, a PhD candidate and Vanier Scholar at U Toronto :canada:

- I'm a computational ecologist interested in understanding the processes that shape biodiversity dynamics in an era of global climate change. I enjoy working both at global and local scales, with rights and stakeholders, in order to produce work that informs conservation. For my PhD, I'm working with [Marty Krkosek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto's  Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
- I combine data synthesis, quantitative, molecular, and field-based approaches to investigate drivers of population dynamics and ecological stability. My ongoing projects include:
    - quantifying drivers of nonlinear population dynamics
    - identifying mechanisms promoting stability in exploited species
    - wild salmon conservation in collaboration with the [Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw Fisheries Group](https://mdfgfisheries.ca/) and [Salmon Coast](https://salmoncoast.org/) :fish: 
    - characterizing species stress responses to rising temperatures
    - developing new environmental RNA and DNA methods for biomonitoring
