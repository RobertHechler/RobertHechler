### Hi, I'm Rob, a PhD candidate and Vanier Scholar at U Toronto :canada:

- I'm interested in understanding how aquatic biodiversity responds to environmental change and do this using molecular and quantitative methods. My goal is to produce work that informs conservation and policy practices, working both at global and local scale with rights and stakeholders.
- For my PhD, I'm working with [Marty Krkosek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto
- My research projects include:
    - biodiversity responses to heat stress via environmental RNA and DNA 
    - wild salmon conservation in collaboration with the [Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw Fisheries Group](https://mdfgfisheries.ca/) and [Salmon Coast](https://salmoncoast.org/) :fish: 
    - nonlinear population dynamics to understand why populations fluctuate as they do
